## ¬†üìö Introduction 

This project explores the fascinating world of diamonds and seeks to predict their price based on a variety of factors. We aim to uncover the hidden relationships between diamond characteristics and their value, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of the diamond market.

The purpose of this predictive analysis is to create a website that determines the price of a diamond based on its characteristics: carat, cut, color, clarity, price, depth, table, x (length), y (width), and z (depth). 
However, in extreme cases where a quick estimate of a diamond‚Äôs value is needed, it is not feasible to spend time defining all these characteristics. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a study of the database to determine what are the minimum necessary characteristics to accurately estimate the price of a diamond. To implement the project, it is essential to assess how each characteristic of the diamond influences its price. This requires discovering how the variability of a characteristic can affect the variability of the price. Therefore, the use of statistical strategies will be crucial to answer these questions and ensure the accuracy of the diamond value estimate

## Dataset üìä

The dataset used in this project is "Diamonds_values_faltantes.csv" and includes the following columns:

| Column Name | Description |
|---|---|
| carat | Weight of the diamond in carats |
| cut | Quality of the diamond's cut (Ideal, Premium, Very Good, Good, Fair) |
| color | Color of the diamond (D, E, F, G, H, I, J) |
| clarity | Clarity of the diamond (IF, VVS1, VVS2, VS1, VS2, SI1, SI2, I1) |
| depth | Percentage of the diamond's depth |
| table | Percentage of the diamond's table width |
| price | Price of the diamond in US dollars |
| x | Length of the diamond in millimeters |
| y | Width of the diamond in millimeters |
| z | Depth of the diamond in millimeters |

## Metodology üõ†Ô∏è

### Loading and Data Exploration

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import math
import numpy as np
from sklearn.impute import KNNImputer
from sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder

import random
# Mudar o caminho da base de dados
path = r"DataBases\Diamonds_values_faltantes.csv"
diamonds = pd.read_csv(fr"{path}")

diamonds
```

###  Visualization of the linear correlation coefficient and separation of the dataset, for better KNN implementation. 

Below is the number of missing values per column

 <br>

```python
counter = {}
for x in range(diamonds.shape[1]):
    column_name = diamonds.columns[x]
    counter[column_name] = diamonds.shape[0] - len(diamonds[column_name].dropna())

counter_df = pd.DataFrame(list(counter.items()), columns=['Coluna', 'Quantidade de NaN'])
counter_df

plt.figure(figsize = (8, 6))
sns.heatmap((diamonds[["carat", "depth", "table", "price", "x", "y", "z"]]).corr(), vmin = -1, vmax = 1, annot = True, cmap = 'magma')
plt.title("Coeficiente de Correla√ß√£o Linear")
plt.show()
```

Resource Engineering
Analysis of the heat map above based on price:
We can conclude that the price does not have a good correlation with the total percentage of the diamond (depth) and also does not have a high correlation with the table, with an inversely proportional correlation of -0.0086 with depth, and a proportional relationship of 0.13 with the table.
We can also conclude that the price has a good linear correlation with the carat of 0.92, x (length) of 0.89, y (width) of 0.89, and z (depth) of 0.88.

Based on this heat map analysis, we can conclude that the larger the carat, x (length), y (width), and z (depth), the higher the diamond's price can be.

However, there may be some cases where a diamond has a very high carat but a low price, just as there may be diamonds with a low carat but a high price. This can also happen with x (length), y (width), and z (depth). Because of this, we question the following: how well can the carat, x (length), y (width), and z (depth) determine the value of the diamond? To answer this, we need to derive the Coefficient of Determination.
